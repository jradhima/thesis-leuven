       " 'In its first response to a Justice Department lawsuit in October that accuses the company of antitrust violations, Google filed a forceful rebuke, saying it “developed, continually innovated and promoted” its search product as part of its mission to “organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful.”\\nThe filing, Google’s GOOG,\\n+0.39%\\nmost significant amid three antitrust suits in recent weeks, offered an aggressive blueprint for its legal defense in a case that is likely to stretch for years. (Amit Mehta, the federal judge hearing the case, last week said the trial would not start until 2023.)\\n“People use Google Search because they choose to, not because they are forced to or because they cannot easily find alternative ways to search for information on the internet,” the company said in a defiant 42-page filing. The company’s denial of the claims was granular, often offering sentence-by-sentence replies.\\nGoogle’s detailed response to the Justice Department suit is part of a multipronged legal strategy as the search-engine power fends off three suits.\\nOn Wednesday, the Texas Attorney General and other Republican AGs filed a lawsuit that claims Google broke the law to obtain and protect a monopoly over the technology that delivers ads across the internet.\\nThe following day, a bipartisan coalition of AGs led by Colorado and Nebraska expanded on accusations about Google’s search-engine business made by the Justice Department. The suit seeks to combine cases with the federal lawsuit.\\n')"
